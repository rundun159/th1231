I participated in 1st and 2nd round of '2020 AI Grand Challenge' as a member of  Computer vision start-up called 'Nuvi Lab'. And won 5th and 3rd winner.<br/><br/>
The code is confidential, so I couldn't upload the code. <br/><br/>
I did EDA, pre-processing, trained model, and implemented the total pipeline with other members.<br/><br/>
I trained single-label classifiers and tried some methodologies to make it perform better.<br/><br/>
I added certificate pdf in 'certificate' directory.

I participated in 1st and 2nd round of '2020 AI Grand Challenge' as a member of  Computer vision start-up called 'Nuvi Lab'. And won 5th and 3rd winner.
</div>
<h2> MathMatical_MultiLine_Segmentation </h2>
<div>
I implemented a system which does skew detection and line segmentation on handwritten multi-line mathematical expressions.<br>
It was developed on C++ using openCV library.

<h1> Detailed Explanation</h1>
<hr></hr>
<h2> VLDB </h2>
<div>
1. I implemented greedy garbage collection using simple SSD simulator from Operating System:Three Easy Pieces(https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).<br>
2. I analyzed TRIM ON/OFF differences on YCSB using RocksDB. 'YCSB_About_Result.md' file is the simple report.</div>
<hr></hr>
<h2> MathMatical_MultiLine_Segmentation </h2>
<div>
I implemented a system which does skew detection and line segmentation on handwritten multi-line mathematical expressions.<br>
It was developed on C++ using openCV library.<br>
I designed my own algorithm, and I made it on recognizing matrix, fraction, limitation, and summation expression as one line, rather than recognizing them as several lines. It was developed without using machine learning algorithms.

<h2> SKKU </h2>
<div>
I am an undergraduate student of Sungkyunkwan University Computer Engineering major. <br>
I have taken many courses, and here I uploaded my works I have done on lectures. <br>
Below are explanations about works <br>
</div>
<h4> AI (Artificial Intelligence) </h4>
<div>
I uploaded my project. It was to classify documents. <br>
Feature extraction of documents was done using TF-IDF algorithm. <br>
And I desinged neural networks several times and compared the results.<br>
Implementation was done on Keras <br>
I uploaded md files that contain result analysis.
</div>
<h4>
CV (Computer Vision)
</h4>
<div>
I uploaded several works.</div>
<div>First One was to implement edge detector and corner detector using Convolution Algorithm with several filters. </div>
<div>Second One was to implement feature matching and warping. </div>
<div>Last One was to implement image searching. I implemented this using clustering on image features extracted using SIFT. </div>
<h4>
PL  (Programming Language)
</h4>
<div>
It was to use one of C library, "flex/bison" <br>
Using this, I made a math expression parser <br>
& Kotlin Parser switching Kotlin code to Java code
</div>
<h4>
BD  (Big Data)
</h4>
<div>
My project was to classify given face images as male or female.<br>
I used Kernel SVM and I developed some kernel function optimized to this problem.<br>
But, it didn't work better. I implemented on Python using SciPy library
</div>
<h4>
DB (Database)
</h4>
<div>
Three works uploaded.<br>
First one was to implement B+ tree on C.<br>
Second one was to implement simple web page using Django.<br>
Last one was to implement simple multi threading using Hadoop.
</div>
<h4>
ML (Machine Learning)
</h4>
<div>
  There are four works and one term project. Works were usually done on skeleton codes. <br>
  All implementations were done on python. Works were implemented using only numpy library. And term project was implemented on Keras.<br>
First One was to implement Logistic regression.<br>
Second One was to implement multi class classifier using single neural layer.<br>
Third One was to implement Deep Neural Network.<br>
Fourth One was to implement CNN(Convolutional Neural Network).<br>
  The project was about noisy data detection. <br>
  I implemented based on 'Identifying Mislabeled Data using the Area Under the Margin Ranking' paper.<br>
  </div>

<h4>
AL (Algorithm)
</h4>
<div>
Three works are uploaded. All of them are implemented on C<br>
First one was to solve sorting problem using Bitmask and Radix sort on C.<br>
Second one was to solve sorting problem using Dynamic Programming.<br>
Last one was to parse input string and encode them using Huffman Tree.

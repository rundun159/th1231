I am an undergraduate student of Sungkyunkwan University Computer Engineering major. <br>
I have taken many courses, and here I uploaded my works I have done on lectures. <br>
Below are explanations about works <br>
</div>
<h3>
AI (Aritificial Inteligence)
</h3>
<div>
I uploaded my project. It was to classify documents. <br>
Feature extraction of documents was done using TF-IDF algorithm. <br>
And I desinged neural networks several times and compared the results.<br>
Implementation was done on Keras <br>
I uploaded md files that contain result analysis.

<h3>
CV (Computer Vision)
</h3>
<div>
I uploaded several works.<br>
**First One** was to implement edge detector and corner detector using Convolution Algorithm with several filters. <br>
**Second One ** was to implement feature matching and warping. <br>
**Last one** was to implement image searching. I implemented this using clustering on image features extracted using SIFT. <br>

<h2>
Codes that I submitted to kaggle competitions.<br>
Especially, I participated in 'Bengali.AI Handwritten Grapheme Classification' competition.<br>
Here I used 'Efficientnet' for multi-label classification on Keras<br>
The model learned on MNIST Data, first. And it was transfer learned on given Bengali Data<br>

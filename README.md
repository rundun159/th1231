SKKU

<div>
I am an undergraduate student of Sungkyunkwan University Computer Engineering major. <br>
I have taken many courses, and here I uploaded my works I have done on lectures. <br>
Below are explanations about works <br>
</div>
<h3>
AI (Aritificial Inteligence)
</h3>
<div>
I uploaded my project. It was to classify documents. <br>
Feature extraction of documents was done using TF-IDF algorithm. <br>
And I desinged neural networks several times and compared the results.<br>
Implementation was done on Keras <br>
I uploaded md files that contain result analysis.
</div>
<h3>
CV (Computer Vision)
</h3>
<div>
I uploaded several works.</div>
<div>First One was to implement edge detector and corner detector using Convolution Algorithm with several filters. </div>
<div>Second One was to implement feature matching and warping. </div>
<div>Last One was to implement image searching. I implemented this using clustering on image features extracted using SIFT. </div>
<h3>
PL  (Programming Language)
</h3>
<div>
It was to use one of C library, "flex/bison" <br>
Using this, I made a math expression parser <br>
& Kotlin Parser switching Kotlin code to Java code
</div>

<h2>
  Kaggle
  </h2>
<div>
Codes that I submitted to kaggle competitions.<br>
Especially, I participated in 'Bengali.AI Handwritten Grapheme Classification' competition.<br>
Here I used 'Efficientnet' for multi-label classification on Keras<br>
The model learned on MNIST Data, first. And it was transfer learned on given Bengali Data<br>

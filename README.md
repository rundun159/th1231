3_1 : AI (Aritificial Inteligence) CV (Computer Vision) PL (Programming Language)<br>
3_2 : BD (BigData Analysis) DB (Database) ML (Machine Learning)<br>
4_1 : AL (Algorithm)<br>
</div>

<h2> Problem Solving</h2>

<div>
I solved some algorithm problems using C++ & python. <br>
I uploaded my codes.
</div>
<h2>
ToBigs
</h2>
<div>
ToBigs(http://www.datamarket.kr/xe/page_SKdp53) is a union club where students from variety majors and campuses learn machine learning algorithms.
Here, I uploaded some assignments I submitted. <br>
</div>
<h2>
Kaggle
</h2>
<div>
I joined 'Bengali.AI handwritten grapheme classification' competition.(https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19)<br>
</div>

<h1> Detailed Explanation</h1>
<hr></hr>
<h2> VLDB </h2>
<div>
1. I implemented greedy garbage collection using simple SSD simulator from Operating System:Three Easy Pieces(https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).<br><br>
2. I analyzed TRIM ON/OFF differences on YCSB using RocksDB. 'YCSB_About_Result.md' file is the simple report.</div>
<hr></hr>

<h2> 2020 AI Grand Challenge </h2>
<div>
I did EDA, pre-processing, trained model, and implemented the total pipeline with other members.<br/>
I trained single-label classifiers and tried some methodologies to make it perform better.
<br/>
I added certificate pdf in 'certificate' directory.

<h2> MathMatical MultiLine Segmentation </h2>
<div>
This was developed on C++ using openCV library.
It was developed without using machine learning algorithms.
<br><br>
It consists of three steps.<br>
1. It detects the skewnewss of handwritten lines using huff transform algorithm.  <br>
2. It corrects the skewnewss using OpenCV function. <br>
3. It performs line segmentation following my own algorithm. <br><br>
I implemented this system on my own, and this one works well on recognizing matrix, fraction, limitation, and summation expression as one line, rather than recognizing them as several lines.

<h2> SKKU </h2>
<div>
I am an undergraduate student of Sungkyunkwan University Computer Engineering major. <br>
I have taken many courses, and here I uploaded my works I have done on lectures. <br>
Below are explanations about works <br>
</div>
<h4> AI (Artificial Intelligence) </h4>
<div>
I uploaded my project. It was to classify documents. <br>
Feature extraction of documents was done using TF-IDF algorithm. <br>
And I desinged neural networks several times and compared the results.<br>
It was implemented using Keras <br>
I uploaded md files that contain result analysis.
</div>
<h4>
CV (Computer Vision)
</h4>
<div>
I uploaded several works.</div>
<div>
1. Implementations of edge detector and corner detector using Convolution Algorithm with several filters. <br/>
2. Implementations of  feature matching and warping. <br/>
3. Implementations of  image searching. I implemented this using clustering on image features extracted using SIFT. </div>
<h4>
PL  (Programming Language)
</h4>
<div>
It was to use one of C library, "flex/bison" <br>
Using this, I made a math expression parser <br>
& Kotlin Parser switching Kotlin code to Java code
</div>
<h4>
BD  (Big Data)
</h4>
<div>
My project was to classify given face images as male or female.<br>
I used Kernel SVM and I developed some kernel function optimized to this problem.<br>
But, it didn't perform better. I implemented on Python using SciPy library.
</div>
<h4>
DB (Database)
</h4>
<div>
Three implementations uploaded.<br>
1. B+ tree using C.<br>
2. simple web page using Django.<br>
3. simple multi threading using Hadoop.
</div>
<h4>
ML (Machine Learning)
</h4>
<div>
  There are four implementations and one term project. Works were usually done on skeleton codes. <br>
  They are all implemented using python.And Numpy and Keras libraries are used.<br>
1. Logistic regression.<br>
2. multi class classifier using single neural layer.<br>
3. Deep Neural Network.<br>
4. CNN(Convolutional Neural Network).<br>
* The project was about noisy data detection. <br>
  I implemented based on 'Identifying Mislabeled Data using the Area Under the Margin Ranking' paper.<br>
  </div>

<h4>
AL (Algorithm)
</h4>
<div>
Three implementations are uploaded. All of them are implemented using C<br>
1. Solving sorting problem using Bitmask and Radix sort on C.<br>
2. Solving sorting problem using Dynamic Programming.<br>
3. Parsing input string and encoding them using Huffman Tree.

I am an undergraduate student of Sungkyunkwan University Computer Engineering major. <br>
I have taken many courses, and here I uploaded my works I have done on lectures. <br>
Below are explanations about works <br>
</div>
<h4>
AI (Aritificial Inteligence)
</h4>
<div>
I uploaded my project. It was to classify documents. <br>
Feature extraction of documents was done using TF-IDF algorithm. <br>
And I desinged neural networks several times and compared the results.<br>
Implementation was done on Keras <br>
I uploaded md files that contain result analysis.
</div>
<h4>
CV (Computer Vision)
</h4>
<div>
I uploaded several works.</div>
<div>First One was to implement edge detector and corner detector using Convolution Algorithm with several filters. </div>
<div>Second One was to implement feature matching and warping. </div>
<div>Last One was to implement image searching. I implemented this using clustering on image features extracted using SIFT. </div>
<h4>
PL  (Programming Language)
</h4>
<div>
It was to use one of C library, "flex/bison" <br>
Using this, I made a math expression parser <br>
& Kotlin Parser switching Kotlin code to Java code
</div>
<h4>
BD  (Big Data)
</h4>
<div>
My project was to classify given face images as male or female.<br>
I used Kernel SVM and I developed some kernel function optimized to this problem.<br>
But, it didn't better. I implemented on Python using SciPy library
</div>
<h4>
DB (Database)
</h4>
<div>
Three works uploaded.<br>
First one was to implement B+ tree on C.<br>
Second one was to implement simple web page using Django.<br>
Last one was to implement simple multi threading using Hadoop.
</div>
<h4>
ML (Machine Learning)
</h4>
<div>
  There are four works and one term project. Works were usually done on skeleton codes. <br>
  All implementations were done on python. Works were implemented using only numpy library. And term project was implemented on Keras.<br>
First One was to implement Logistic regression.<br>
Second One was to implement multi class classifier using single neural layer.<br>
Third One was to implement Deep Neural Network.<br>
Fourth One was to implement CNN(Convolutional Neural Network).<br>
  The project was about noisy data detection. <br>
  I implemented based on 'Identifying Mislabeled Data using the Area Under the Margin Ranking' paper.<br>
  </div>
<h2>
  Kaggle
  </h2>
<div>
Codes that I submitted to kaggle competitions.<br>
Especially, I participated in 'Bengali.AI Handwritten Grapheme Classification' competition.<br>
Here I used 'Efficientnet' for multi-label classification on Keras<br>
The model learned on MNIST Data, first. And it was transfer learned on given Bengali Data<br>
